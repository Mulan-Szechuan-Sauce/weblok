step one for the client:

send "join 1234" # Joining room number 1234
Server finds the room, or creates a new one
if there are too many players, tell the client to go away
otherwise, tell them they can come into the room, and give them a client ID

step two for the client:
every 10 seconds, send an hello message
server distributes the message to all other clients, with the client ID prepended to the message
